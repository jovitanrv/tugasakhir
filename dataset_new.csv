"Hi my family and I are booked to travel to Bali via Thailand on the 13th of March. I will be travelling with my parents and my young children (1 & 7). I was wondering if it was safe to go to Bali at this time and whether there being zero reported Corona Virus cases was true for Bali? The company that I have booked my villa through have been following up with me for my balance payment and assure me that Bali is safe but it would be great to hear from other travellers that are planning to visit or already there.","1"
"Hello Vishal, If you believe the latest statistics being 3 cases in India, 35 cases in Thailand and still none in Bali. You are safer in Bali than anywhere else. I’m in Bali atm and life is as normal here.","1"
"Hi Glenn, Thanks for your response. For me it was a bigger concern when I read that Bali/Indonesia has zero cases as the virus has reached parts of Europe as well which is much further away - is it really true? Some say that it’s because they don’t have test kits over there, others say it’s being hidden so it doesn’t hit tourism...I hope you have a safe trip in Bali and do share some updates if you hear anything. Thanks again","0"
"We are also travelling to Bali on the same day via Bangkok and really worried about the situation .","0"
"On a positive note , I havent read of any Australians returning from Bali infected.I think by now we would of heard something.Goodluck","1"
"It is very much a personal decision as to whether to cancel or proceed with travel plans. Perhaps you could consider that statistically there is a much higher percentage of risk of catching various diseases and/or being involved in a nasty traffic accident both in your home city or anywhere else in the world.","0"
"When SARS happened, Indonesia was zero SARS patient and nowadays also zero positive Covid-19 patient. Every year there are 1.4 million people go to Middle East for Umroh, Haj or working there, so Indonesia is always aware of Corona Virus such as MERS. Indonesia is also aware of Bird Flu virus of migrant birds from north and south hemisphere, however Bird Flu virus is different with Corona Virus. So, Indonesia can easily detect the viruses, if any.","1"
"Does no reports mean no cases???","1"
"There are about 50 Covid-19 suspect patients. Even who get common cold is checked and all of them are negative of Covid-19.","0"
"LeeLou, have a look at the other threads on this subject - there's been much debate about just that. So far, I've not read any details of what kinds of tests are being used, their accuracy and under what criteria they are being applied. The thing that does reassure me is, as LimitedEdition points out, there don't seem to be any people reporting symptoms coming home from Bali.","1"
"That is true, they cooperation with Kobe University and have found the reagent for identify Covid-19. For common all Corona virus, Indonesia has do testing more than ten years. If positive, so the sample will be tested in Jakarta for assay, so will know what kinds of Corona Virus, needs about 2 days for it. With reagent needs only hours.","1"
"Until nowadays there are no Covid-19 positive patient in Indonesia.There are one Indonesia citizen got Covid-19 positive in Singapore and 4 of Indonesian citizens got Covid-19 positive in Diamond Princess Cruise Ship as crews from 78 Indonesian crews means about 5 percent. But more than a fourth or more than 25 percent of the 1,700 passengers got Covid-19 positive, means high risk to use cruise ship. Most of the passengers are old persons, whereas most of the crew are young persons. So, if you are healthy and still young, you are more safe than if you are old person.","1"
"Thank you for the reassurance Sarwa. It’s promising to know that people returning to Australia from Indonesia are free from the virus, that’s a positive. I will be traveling via Singapore next month and plan to avoid contact with people as much as possible. We don’t have a single case of the virus in SA so it is definitely possible not to have it and l really don’t think anyone is hiding something.","1"
"You must take safe action outside Indonesia and outside SA, because 2 positive Covid-19 patients has been found in Iran. Until nowadays Africa is still safe.","1"
"Follow-up to my previous comments - just to let you know came back from Bali last Thursday evening after 10 days unscathed except for damn mozzie bites from being at the Villa - take your Aeroguard or similar. If you want to feel safe on the plane and airport then get your family the right masks but it's the hand sanitising which is more important (as it should be anyway). I was the only one that I saw wear one on way up in plane and didn't worry on way home - not many people even in streets etc wearing them there. Read up on the Virus symptoms and how to catch it. I read it was only 4-5 hours window and mainly from surfaces and then you touch your facial orefaces and bam you MAY get it, so just watch the public things. I only saw one young woman in Matahari with a head cold and she is the one who should have had a mask on. Only person on my home plane trip who had a mask on was an elderly lady and me being 67 not much older than myself. The local are feeling the pinch from people cancelling and are struggling again. The Hotel where I stayed initially - The Green Garden - said it was quieter than usual and same with drivers and taxis I used while there. So go and spend lots of money as their economy needs it too. I also heard Singapore is very quiet on the streets too so all this drama is having an effect everywhere. Enjoy your time with family and if you feeling uncomfortable around someone coughing and spluttering (which may only be a cold) just do normal cautions.","1"
"PS sorry - stayed in a Villa in Jimbaran Village area and wasn't really in a lot of Public places often like general shopping malls etc so your isolation there may be okay. Just buy some Glen 20 or similar when you get there and wipe things down that bubs may touch or lick just as a precaution.","0"
"I’m here at the moment with 2 kids. There were a few people at the airport wearing masks, but that’s it. I have no concerns about Coronavirus over here. I’d be more worried about the transit through Thailand - I’d wear a mask there. We brought P2 masks over with us (we needed them at home with the bushfires) but haven’t felt the need to wear them in Bali.","1"
"Its safe you can visit Bali without any tension.but better to carry mask you never know anything can happen as many Chinese tourist travelling Bali and other Asian countries.","0"
"I agree with Dipen N. So far no announcements have been made about coronavirus cases in Indonesia, but probably it is a just a matter of time. It's starting to spread globally now and Indonesia is one of the only countries in Asia not to have announced any cases despite there being a lot of contact with China and lots of Chinese visitors. Unfortunately it seems many people are more concerned about being quarantined than about having the virus. Anyway, it sounds fine to visit Bali for now, just bring good quality face masks just in case (they will sell out almost immediately if any case is confirmed) and bring plenty of hand sanitizer.","1"
"The one thing to be aware of is does your travel insurance cover you? Otherwise go for it!","1"
"One thing to be aware of is that most travel insurances exclude pandemics from coverage so if WHO does declare Covid-19 a pandemic, it will not cover any coronavirus-related expenses.","0"
"I checked with our insurance company, Insure & Go, this morning for our trip later in May. They advised that we’ll be covered if the Australian Government issues a Do Not Travel advisory. Otherwise, there’s no other cover. Fingers crossed that it doesn’t come to that and this somehow settles down. Cheers","1"
"I am travelling to Bali in May and my travel insurance provider has issued a blanket ""No"" any pandemic/epidemic. Can you please confirm that your insurance provider will only cover you if the Australian government issues a ""Not Safe To Travel "" warning. I thought that warning would have negated any form of travel insurance.","1"
"Singapore Airlines have cancelled some of their flights to and from the USA, however l got an email from them yesterday telling me of their huge infrastructure that they have put in place to keep passengers safe, pleased to see they are scrubbing down all aircraft beforehand, keeping passengers in safe areas in transit and everyone gets screened on arrival in Singapore. Luckily SA doesn’t have a single case of the virus and people are going on holiday as normal, hope someone doesn’t come back with the virus.","0"
"Bali is safe, at least is for China Tourists who will stay longer in Bali, Indonesia. For the second time Indonesian Government has given Special Visa to almost 1,000 China Tourists who will extent to stay longer in Indonesia for the next 30 days. One month ago more than 1,200 China Tourists apply for Special Visa and all has been given. Previously there are a plane want to pickup China Tourists from Bali. But only about 80 persons do it. The plane is very empty, because the capacity of the plane is about 300 passengers.","1"
"You know that Bali is at risk as much as anyhere else in the world. What we all need to weigh up is mass infection, and the capability of a country's infrastructure to cope with this.","0"
"Singapore Airlines, as great as they are, cannot control the virus or it's spread. It's no secret that Asian based airlines have had many cancellations, so all are doing their best to try to reasure existing passengers while simultaneously attempting to minimise substantial financial losses. If you want an example of what it really takes to disinfect a large aircraft, have a look at what Qantas did recently after they collected Aussies from China. Compare the two and then rethink just how effective SIA's measures will actually be. Cheers","1"
"l can only hope for the best and lm happy at least they are doing something.","1"
"From the Financial Times this morning: Headline - ""Bali doctor: if there is a coronavirus patient, I'll be infected"" Medical workers have warned that the Indonesian holiday island of Bali is severely underprepared to deal with the deadly coronavirus, threatening its 4m inhabitants and a tourist industry worth billions of dollars each year. Interviews with staff at the three Bali hospitals earmarked to treat victims of a virus that has infected more than 80,000 people around the world point to a lack of equipment, staff and infrastructure required to deal with an outbreak. “I’m not convinced,” Ni Ketut Pande Sri Widnyani, senior doctor at Sanjiwani Gianyar hospital, one of the facilities, said of Bali’s ability to handle such a crisis. “Right now we’re not up to the required standard,” she said of the hospital. “There’s a lack of facilities and I pray we won’t be infected.” Indonesia, the world’s fourth-most populous country, has yet to report a single confirmed case of the coronavirus despite its strong economic ties with the rest of Asia and especially China where the illness originated. Given that the virus has quickly spread to almost 40 countries, international experts question whether this is credible. “The fact that Indonesia has not reported any cases is highly unusual,” said Ian Mackay, a virologist at Queensland University in Australia, noting that Bali was a top destinations for travellers from Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak. “In a major destination for visitors from China we would expect to see infected patients.” Bali is considered particularly exposed to a virus outbreak because of its popularity with mainland Chinese who accounted for 1.2m of its more than 6m international visitors last year. After China declared the outbreak in January some of these tourists extended their stay in Bali rather than going home. A large number of Indonesians also work in China, often as domestic helpers...","1"
"Hi guys! My fam (husband and 1 and 3 year old) are due to go to Bali with a Luxury Escapes deal on the 14th March. I called luxury escapes, long hold time, and was advised it’s at the hotel’s discretion if they allow us to change dates as we are inside of the 45 day allowable period. Luxury Escapes contacted our hotel, cc’ing me, and the hotel have said that while Bali is safe, they will allow me to rebook up until Dec this year. Tail watching and waiting, but I think I’ll change our dates to go later in the year.","1"
"Thanks froweoverseas, we’re still waiting to hear back from Luxury Escapes re our May holiday. It’s good to hear there may be some flexibility re current bookings. Cheers","1"
"Hi just wanted to maybe offer some advice I'm only flying in September to bali but have been keeping a careful eye on the spread of the Corona virus I found the best up to date truthful unbiased report is on the w.h.o website And it gives all the stats confirmed cases etc...maybe this will help you.","1"
"Hi, The president said today that they have two confirmed cases of corona in Indonesians who were in contact with the Japanese tourists who came to indonesia with the virus. There may be more cases but it’s not clear from the statement how extensive the tracing of contacts is. Cheers","1"
"As of this morning we have decided to cancel our visit to Bali. Sadly the villa company “Asia Holiday Retreats” has said that they cannot refund our money or allow us credit to use this in the future, which is sad. I know the hospitality business has been hit bad but to hold you ransom when the world is on the brink of a global pandemic is just silly.","0"
"Best to check the w.h.o website for all up to date information.","1"
"No intention of canceling my Bali trip and don't quite understand peoples 'panic' (probably because they are the first 3 and last 2 letters of 'pandemic'). Pandemic means widespread. Does not mean epidemic. I am more worried about the Italians at work who travel back and forth to Italy every weekend. If it was prevalent in Bali despite the 'iffy' Indonesian reporting of cases I'm pretty sure given the number of Ozzies traveling to Bali every week if some had brought it back to Oz we'd know about it pretty quickly.","1"
"I am travelling to Bali in June and from what I read on the net, the Virus might well be around after the flu season is over. I have non refundable Air Tickets pre booked with Singapore Airlines. So I think I am going to go and tell myself that it is as likely to infect me in India as in Bali. 2 cases reported today in Indonesia and 2 cases in India as well. Please tell me, friends, that I am taking the right call :)","1"
"Yes, it's probably as likely that you will fall ill in India. It's an issue of the lesser of two weevils, I think.","0"
"Your post was so refreshing as it is what I have been mentioning to your fellow countrymen all along. I most sincerely hope that you have a great time and very much enjoy your holiday.","1"
"I've been travelling Asia since Dec 8. I've been asked so many times if people should cancel their trips. I made a little 9 minute vlog about what I've seen and my thoughts on going vs cancelling. If you have a few min... Take a look. Hope it helps. In Bali now (for almost 2 weeks) ... I realllllly wouldn't worry about it. No one os wearing masks. Not a single person has so much as sneezed around me. Wash hands often. Try not to touch your face and you'll be fine.","0"
"Thank you. We have a spring break trip leaving SFO and flying via Taipei to Bali at end of month. Hoping we don't have to cancel - mainly concerned about quarantines when returning back to California.","1"
"Hi Vishal, just wanna ask you that you are still planning to go as I have also planned to Bali on 11 mar and confused whether its safe or not.","1"
"Are you aware that cases of people with this virus have been recorded in India? If so, why would you think that Bali would be less safe than your own country?","1"
"India now has over 28 confirmed cases of the virus. Bali lists only 2...Its not about Bali being safer than India - its just that when you travel, you tend to go out more - visit public places - eat out at busy areas and come in contact with far more people than you would on your average day being in your home country. The bigger worry is to go through air ports and such because of the number of people that go through them everyday. If it were not for travel, the virus would have not spread outside of Wuhan in the first place. Just my two bits.","1"
"I have gone ahead and cancelled my trip, I know many that are still going ahead with their travel plans, so I guess its to each his own...I just felt it was not worth the risk, especially as I had my parents and children on this trip with me.","0"
"I didn't know that Bali had any confirmed cases. I know there are two confirmed cases in Jakarta which is nearly 1200 km away. However, it seems that Indonesians are becoming more concerned and getting worried. Vishal, each to his own, and with young kids and myself not so young anymore I would probably do as you have done.","1"
"Funny as from current reports young kids aren't at risk. Kids under 10 don't seem to be susceptible (quite how a virus knows your age at that age I don't know). Kids More likely to just be carriers than suffer anything of the affects. Basically the older you are the riskier it is.","0"
"It's definitely to each his own. No one should be judging anyone if they decide to postpone their plans. What we know so far is that this is hitting the body harder than the regular flu. Also, the mortality rate is higher than the regular flu. It's rubbish to say that if you aren't scared of the flu, you shouldn't be scared of COVID-19... On the flipside, there shouldn't be sheer panic. Yes, I did see initial reports that say it seems that kids are less susceptible for getting sick. Again, scientists and health officials are still learning about this. It doesn't mean that kids are less likely to carry the virus. Hell, it could even be the opposite. Kids can still carry and spread. Some kids aren't showing symptoms even though the have the COVID-19. I decided to include news articles from credible sources when I post facts, so people can read the articles for themselves. I like to do what I can as to not spread innuendos and misinformation.","1"
"Hi i have also planned to visit bali on march 11 so did you decide ? Whether you are going or not ?","1"
"Ignorance is bliss.....if anyone thinks Bali is coronavirus free you need to rethink your life. It will be a mess once the truth is out. For the person who said you could get it at home!!!!! Well at home better health care. Bali increases 55% of complications due to very poor health system.","1"
"I'm leaving Bali on the 10th...it's perfectly safe in my opinion.. I've seen like 8 people wearing masks.. I personally wouldn't postpone","1"
"Most sees are mild (81%) you have a higher chance dying from the flu. It's fear and hype.. Trust me, been in asia since December.. You dont get to see how normal most countries are here... I completely understand the fear and concern, so of course you need to do what's right for you and your loved ones.. But honestly i see how things are here.. No need to be afraid","1"
"Mickey, there's a higher chance of dying from the flu simply because more people have had the seasonal flu vs the COVID-19. COVID-19 is very new and still unfolding. COVID-19 actually has a higher death rate than the seasonal flu. You can look at my previous posts for my sources or Google that information on any credible news source. So what you have repeated isn't an accurate statistic. I'm not trying to get into a debate, but I just had to clarify that","0"
"NotaPigsty: you wrote “Pandemic means widespread. Does not mean epidemic”. That is incorrect. The WHO has this definition: A pandemic is defined as “an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people”.","1"
"Fair enough. I based it on a few different articles I read. I agree theres a lot of info and at the same time lack there of. Not to mention the misinformation. It's hard to know whats right, even from solid government sources which then is the corrected/update. No debate here. Gotta do what's right for you. My perspective, it's more of a threat to elderly people and those with underlying issues. I know fewr sells subscriptions.. Good news, not so much so people are jumping on the fear wagon. That's my opinion. I very much respect yours and hope you and your loved ones stay healthy and well :)","1"
"I doubt that there are zero corona virus cases in Bali. It may be true that there are zero DETECTED cases in Bali since the majority of COVID-19 infections are harmless and remain undetected. The fatality rate of around 2% only applies to the (largely elderly vulnerable) people who are already showing symptoms and sometimes suffering from serious complications such as pneumonia. But this is almost certainly only a small minority of the actual number of infections. The danger of COVID-19 seems similar to seasonal flu. The real danger is the mass hysteria which is promoted by irresponsible media and government officials who are worried about being seen as indecisive!","0"
"This article’s headline is self-explanatory on the numbers in Indonesia as a whole, so not Bali-centric.
Ultimately, make your assessment and judgment based on your own risk appetite.","1"
"a woman from Jakarta was diagnosed in Melbourne. Seems very likely she contracted it in Indonesia. Jakarta and Bali are miles away from each other and certainly parts of Australia have many cases themselves. I do feel though that once you start exporting cases it becomes a lot more difficult to claim you only have four cases nationwide with any credibility.","1"
"There was one case reported yesterday in Singapore of an Indonesia woman coming in already infected. Indonesia is doing a good job in hiding facts and not preventing the spread of Covid-19. You definitely deserve a medal from the Indonesian govt.","0"
"how on earth is a government going to hide the spread of a virus with people coming in and going back to their own countries? The virus is either there or it isn’t, it’s not exactly something a government can hide.","1"
"Soulwax, I agree that is fairly evident that Indonesia absolutely does not have widespread coronavirus in the thousands like Italy, Korea and Iran. But there is a fairly big range between 6000 and 4. Indonesia does indeed appear to have been lucky thus far (considering their lax testing and contact tracing) and I sincerely hope their luck continues, but as you say - time will tell.","1"
"I got no idea how to rationalise that with a grand total of 4 reported cases, Singapore already had one imported case from Indonesia?","1"
"sing6363 there are no reports in the Straits Times or elsewhere on searches to support your claims. What is the source for your statement.","1"
"Hi friends i have booked bali trip from 16th April 2020. Do u people think is there any chances THAT WE HAVE TO CANCEL OUR TRIP. Plz reply your estimations & probability.","1"
"Singapore has just announced a second import case of Covid-19 from Indonesia. See Case No 147 in attachment and case 148 would also be of interest. As at today, Indonesia has 6 reported cases. How on earth can Singapore have 2 Indonesian import cases when Indonesia supposedly has only 6 in a country with a population of 200+ million.? My guess is there should be at least 10,000 cases in Indonesia for 2 of them to have been imported in Singapore.","1"
"Smartraveller have just posted that Coronavirus in Indonesia and that Bali medical facilities will not have infrastructure to cope Also no testing in Bali Travel advice not increased but does advise about lack of medical care to manage","1"
"So many gullible posts here. I would bet London to a brick there are hundreds of cases in Indonesia and Bali with the amount of Chinese travellers they had in Dec, Jan and part of Feb. Being in denial will eventually come back and bite. When someone catches the disease they wont know because they can't test for it properly. When someone dies, they will call it swine flu or something else - anything but coronavirus. It's all about the $$$ folks. Just as I don't for one second believe cases are slowing in China - absolute nonsense. They tell you what they want you to know - doesn't mean you need to believe it!","0"
"If it is rife in Bali why isn’t there plane loads of Australians coming down with it","1"
"Maybe not so rife in Bali as compared to other cities in Indonesia. But it is a matter of time before plane loads of aussies return back with the virus., as long as Indonesia refuses to acknowledge the spread.","1"
"In Indonesia there are more many cases of Dengeu Fever than Covid-19. Because mosquito can fly a hundred meter and no need close contact among the victims. Covid-19 usually needs close contact among/between the victims.","1"
"Amit. There is no way that anyone who are travellers just like you, would be able to answer your question. I understand that you don’t want to make your own decision and would prefer that others make that for you, however in this situation, you will have to decide for yourself as difficult as that would be.","1"
"Further to Travelkat’s advice, Amit, you firstly need to consider whether anyone in your travel party has any health issues that may place them at risk should they contract this virus. Seek advice from your medical practitioner, read your government’s travel advisories and check the advice from the World Health Organisation. Cheers","1"
"There are at least 11 suspects of Covid-19 in Bali, but all are Negative. Jakarta has more suspects of Covid-19 and nowadays there are 6 positive Covid-19 patients. When there are initial 2 positive Covid-19 patients, there are panic situation, but nowadays not anymore, however some of them, not much use masker. Myself not use anything, because I have no close contact with any Covid-19 patient.","1"
"Regarding the cases you quote in your post 83, namely - Sing. Govt. case 147 and 148. You have used the intro of ""Singapore has just announced a second import case of Covid-19 from Indonesia. ""Case 148 is linked to a cluster of infections that occurred at a private dinner function at SAFRA Jurong in Singapore. Actually I believe it is the largest and most well known Singapore cluster Case 147 is an Indonesian national who arrived in Singapore yesterday, 7th Feb, and tested positive today, 8th of February. There is no mention of which country he arrived ""from"". As for being the second ""import case"" - that can only be referring to the already discredited story you posted last week about people from another small enterprise cluster of infections in Singapore who took the ferry to Batam island and tested positive some days later. Their prior links to numerous infections at ""Wiizlearn"", their place of work in Singapore, are highlighted in the government records.","1"
"Can anyone here comment on access to testing in Bali? And how much it costs?CI read from a minister or head of health authority announcement that the quick test is available in Bali but for the more sensitive test, samples need to be sent to Jakarta.CI've been advised by other countries through their consulates that I should carry test results with me when I leave Bali so I won't be denied entry.","1"
"There are many suspects of Covid-19 in Bali, all are foreign tourists, but all are Negative.Jakarta has more suspects of Covid-19 and nowadays there are 6 positive Covid-19 patients. there are 3 steps, first step is patient in monitoring, there are hundreds of it and second is patient in supervision, there are only 10 patients of it, third step is positive Covid-19 patients and must stay in isolation room until 2 times negative test.","0"
"With all due respect, the corrupt WHO would be among the last group I listen to re coronavirus. Remember, they were dead against any country stopping flights from China and they still refuse to label COVID-19 a pandemic despite the virus being present in 109 countries and rising. Cheers","0"

"The latest import case to Singapore is a rich Indonesian who was already diagnosed of the virus in Jakarta, but decided to hire a PRIVATE plane (to avoid the stricter checks at airports) to get treated in Singapore, which is well known for its high quality healthcare with zero deaths so far, despite having 150+ cases of Covid-19. Only 0.001% of the Indonesian population can afford to hire private plane. And if someone from this 0.001% segment can get infected with Covid-19, even a 10 year old should be able to figure out the extent of the spread of Covid-19 in Indonesia. It should easily exceed 10000 cases,","1"

"105 Chrissie, I am flying to Bali on Saturday. I have been weighing things up almost hourly and if before then I really feel I am at greater risk than here at home, I just won't get on the plane. But right now I feel comfortable continuing with my travel plans. There are posters who flood these threads with conflicting news, most just googled and claim they are all facts. They are not all fact. A WA tourism official has said Australian's should not go to Bali because the money could be better spent in WA. He did not say don't go to Bali because it's dangerous. Don't ask others what they would do, just do what makes you feel ok,","1"

"Baileyburn can you give a link that BIMC give free treatment for the patients. I heard by myself from the Health Minister that all Covid-19 are free, because all hospitals in Indonesia which more than 100 and can handle Covid-19 are Government Hospitrals.","0"
"I know that the testing for Covid-19 is free at government hospitals in Indonesia as long as you have a letter from a doctor, but not sure if that letter can be from any doctor or specifically from a doctor at the government hospital.The government call centre hotline is 112 to get information about Corona virus, and 119 if you feel you may have it or know someone who may have it. But I have no idea if they speak English.","1"
"Diseases caused by COVID-19 are not covered by BPJS Health but directly by the State. This is because BPJS Health's funding sources come from temporary participant contributions because COVID-19 is included in an outbreak, the funding must be directly from the State with funding from the Ministry of Health, Regional Government, or other funding sources deemed valid by law regulations. I think SurfingWild’s advice in post #124 is certainly helpful.","0"

"I'm going to Bali in a couple of weeks with my family. Much safer there, than here in Europe. It seems that the Indonesian authorities are taking this more seriously than here, with screenings and sanitizing the Denpassar Airport etc. Of course they have to, since they are so dependent of tourists visiting. Here in the more developed part of the world (northern Europe) we still see people arriving from northern Italy (Corona epicenter in Europe) without being screened or anything. Upon arriving in the airport they are free to roam and can head straight into the airport subway for example.","1"
"I really don’t understand the extreme panic, travel as normal, we always wear face masks in the airport and on the plane, and use disinfectant etc. that’s been our normal routine. I honestly don’t know why you would get on a filthy plane with recycled air without any sort of respiratory protection, yuck.","0"
"An aviation expert on tv this morning was detailing how air in a plane is 50/50 fresh/recycled and is pumped through hepa air filters which destroy 99% of contaminents and bacterial agents and is only in a cabin for 2 min before replaced again so in actual fact the air in a plane is very clean, I googled it and appears that is quite true.","0"

"Indonesia has confirmed a number of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases. A foreign tourist with COVID-19 died in Bali on 11 March 2020. Consider carefully your need to travel to Indonesia, including Bali, at this time if you have an underlying health condition that may put you at greater risk. There is limited availability of testing and infection control facilities. The risk of transmission of the virus is increasing. Critical care for Australians who become seriously ill, including in Bali, is likely to be significantly below the standards available in Australia. Medical evacuation to Australia may be not be possible and, if it is, very expensive. It may not be covered by travel insurance. Be prepared for travel delays and disruptions, including taking into account what this might mean for your health, and your family, work or study responsibilities.","1"

In saying that I, my wife and 9 month newborn are due to fly out on the 22nd and I am most likely going to postpone. If it was just my wife and I then no problem I would go and take advantage of 5* corona discounts but not taking the risk with new born although young people seem not affected anywhere. The main reason I see is that I have never been to Bali so I want to explore everywhere. To go to a place for the first time and be constantly thinking of not touching this and staying away from crowded places including restaurants and gatherings I think would take the shine of the trip. Going to cost $300 to change flights with Jet* but some friends of ours cancelled their 5* organised trip to Cambodia and Vietnam and lost 50k so plenty of people worse off including those in the poor tourism industry.","1"

"Wendy, I travel to Bali on average twice a year. I was due to fly today but have cancelled. I am no sook - I work in the mining industry, outdoors in the hottest part of Australia. However, common sense in this case just had to prevail. Firstly, as I have stated before, guaranteed that Indonesia will have thousands of undetected cases. Luck plays no part in how this virus spreads. Being in denial is dangerous. From all accounts they don't have the facilities to test or cope, when they can't hide it any more. I would only believe the numbers coming from my own country, Western Europe, UK, Scandinavia, Canada, Singapore and Hong Kong (basically IMO trustworthy countries) And even their numbers wont have captured all cases. The rest of the world's figures you can take with a grain of salt - also my opinion. Unfortunately, there are a couple of people on this post that dribble misinformation taken from their local newspapers and do it consistently and they may be sincere about what they are sprouting, but they can be sincerely wrong.

"Yup, this has been my sentiments for the past several weeks. It's all about trying to protect the tourism dollars instead of doing what is morally right. A lab hasn't been set up because why report numbers when that will hurt tourism. If you don't have ample testing, then you don't have to report confirmed cases. It's like the old saying ""Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies"". I'm just glad that people are starting to take off the blinders and realize that things aren't making sense in Indonesia. Again, it's not about causing panic and doom or trying to ruin someone's vacation. But as inhabitants of this planet, we all need to be truly aware, informed, and educated to flatten the curve of this pandemic.","1"

Airlangga University in Surabaya can do it also and maybe will test it also soon. If the Covid-19 test is positive, there are the second test and it is called Genome DNA Assay Test to avoid False Positive of Covid-19 test. I do not know the other countries do also Genome DNA Assay Test or not. Usually in the second stage from 8 persons, only one is positive Covid-19 or even from 7 persons no one with positive Covid-19.

"I’m seeing lots of fear but not much facts to back it up. I’m here in Bali at the moment and not worried about the coronavirus at all. Actually, I’d much rather be here than in my home country (US) where there have already been a lot more cases and deaths. I may be wrong but I don’t know of any hot/humid country that has had a bad outbreak of this coronavirus. Southeast Asia has an extremely close link to China and this region had detected cases of coronavirus long before Europe and the US, but it never blew up here the way it currently is there. Actually, the virus has been a complete joke in this part of the world. I’m much more worried about car accidents or dengue, which still kills hundreds (thousands?) every year. I’m also worried about the absurd knee jerk reactions from SE Asian countries locking down unnecessarily, like the decision from Cambodia to close after spotting only 7 cases in 2 months (and 0 deaths). I realize some of you think Indonesia is undercounting or covering up coronavirus cases, and that may be true to some extent, but it would be absolutely impossible and absurd to suggest that the virus has been catastrophic here the way it has been in Europe or China. And it would be equally absurd to suggest that every country in Southeast Asia has been doing some masterful coverup of mass casualties from this. Are you guys really trying to say that Singapore has had thousands of cases and deaths like Italy, but they’re hiding it? That is completely insane and paranoid. And what about Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, etc, where the virus has been detected in small quantities for months now but the effects have been undeniably mild? Things could change, but so far the FACT is, the virus has already been here for months and evidently it’s just not capable of doing much damage in this climate.","0"

"There are 8 provinces from 34 provinces in Indonesia got Covid-19, Banten, DKI Jakarta, West Java, Central Java, DI Yogyakarta, Bali, West Kalimantan and North Sulawesi. So, all Java got Covid-19, except East Java. DKI Jakarta has the most number, from the latest data from additional new 17 Covid-19 patients, 14 are from Jakarta, and one each for Banten, West Java and Central Java. These is most active area in Indonesia. So, for outside Java including Bali do not panic. You may read, 102. Re: Corona Virus Situation At Bali 2 days before the match, the governor suggest, but maybe insist to cancel or do the match without soccer fans, the tickets have been sold out and the match day is Persib Anniversary, so the match is still happen with full of soccer fans with hand sanitizing at the entrance gate. In Bandung, only a few people use mask and also in Bekasi, in Jakarta is also no panicking. People know that possibility to get Covid-19 is less than get Dengeu Fever and Covid-19 is less dangerous than Bird Flu.","1"
"Sarwa, you keep repeating the same information again and again. And, why repeat the information about a soccer match between two teams in Bandung? It is totally irrelevant here and in no way useful to the thread. And your advice ""for outside Java including Bali do not panic""....that would seem to mean those living in Java should panic? Great!","1"
"Panic and afraid maybe a little bit, even in Jakarta. There are no rush anymore. People follow government suggestion to reduce activities outside, the consequency, malls, department stores and supermarkets less visitors, so the tenants agree to open the shops in the malls initial at 11am, one hour later than usual and certainly the service charge will be lower. In Australia, Woolies supermarkets even open one hour advance to facilitate senior citizens and disabilities, because they cannot compete with other younger people in usual time. In Indonesia it is not necessary, because most of Indonesian family are extended family. When I go to supermarket there are limitation to buy maximum 3 kilograms granulated sugar cane, I see only one person buy it and only buy it, maybe he need to make coffee in his shack/warung. All stocks I think are adequate include antiseptic soap and alcohol 70 percent, but still lack of mask and hand sanitizer.","0"

"Yesterday morning a male came from Malaysia with temperature 36 degrees Celsius, but seems has dificulty to breath, so he are suspect of Covid-19 and got hospitalization and in the night he passed away.

"The point is, if you have no chronic diseases you may still alive. Most common symptons are fever, fatique and dry cough, but the patient above has only 36 degrees Celsius, fortunately the officers saw he had difficulty to breath. Shortness of breath is also happen for some patients of Covid-19. From Malaysia means imported cases and the patient not go to anywhere, except Malaysia, if the test result of Covid-19 is positive, Indonesia must give data to Malaysia for tracing.","0"
"A lot of villagers etc don’t present themselves for testing as in Bali so “ Until nowadays there are no Covid-19 in big island in Sumatra and Papua” Being realistic, that is not likely and just postponing the inevitable, I hope that they are putting measures in place now! Cheers Mac","1"
"Until nowadays, Bali has only imported case means detection, treatment and tracing in Bali is good, so no spread out from the patient to domestic people. Jakarta with high mobility has some domestic cases, so tracing in cluster and sub-cluster are very important, who are have close contact with patient, must be check one by one, maybe has Covid-19, but most of them are clean. It is hard to do, but it is better than lock down which lock down will ruin the economy, you can imagine for low income people without income for 2 weeks. South Korea do as Indonesia do and successful. I have monitored Bali since WTC attack, Bali Bombing I and II and Bali can survive. Because maybe there are no notice from their countries, so Bali economy move first from domestic tourists, Singaporean, Malaysian and China and as I know and remember Australian come later.","1"

"Indonesia and South Korea certainly different, although both are not make lock down, please read number 268. Certainly Indonesia do harder than SK, because Indonesia is not rich as SK, but Indonesia is not developing country anymore. As per February 10, 2020, the US officially removed Indonesia and a number of other countries—including South Korea, Thailand, Singapore and Vietnam—from the list of developing and least-developed countries. Maybe you do not understand about 'flattening the curve', so I will give example, if a country has capacity of 10,000 beds for handle Covid-19 and there are 20,000 patients of Covid-19 at the same time, so the country cannot handle it, and no one country in the world can overcome the situation like it. So must be flattening the curve means avoid break out from the beginning, so if the 20,000 patients are come gradually in 6 weeks, so the country can handle the Covid-19 patients. In google you can type 'flattening the curve',","1"
"Oh, I expect we all understand flattening the curve quite well, Sarwa. The question that concerns most people on this forum is what, exactly, is the national government doing anout it in Bali? Nepal is a very poor country yet has taken much more serious measures to address this. So, please, give us all a break and either post Bali specific information or set up your own blog.","0"

"The news of indonesian being immune was about a monyh ago by some public figure who is clearly wrong, indomesian govt was very slow in.response to this virus.. and at first they were underestimating this virus by large scale.. Now hospitals are clearly overwhelmed especially in jakarta.. so 19 death are not a surprise really.. more is still to come in weeks,","0"
"Why overwhelmed, I suggest go directly to above hospital, number 284, if you have main symptoms, temperature same or above 38 degrees Celsius, DRY cough. You do not need endorsement from other hospital, if you have main symptoms as above. The problem is frequently people without endorsement go to these hospitals, because they afraid with Covid-19, although they have no close contact with positive Covid-19 patient and have no main symptoms, it make hospitals overwhelmed and moreover they said they have not got any test. Even though there are stages, in monitoring stage, without more severe symptoms, you will not get test of Covid-19, under supervision stage, you are suspect of Covid-19 and will be tested first with corona virus test and usually from 7 patients no one have corona virus and if the corona virus test is positive then test of Covid-19. So, from a thousand of patients, there are only less than a hundred will be tested of Covid-19. After additional from 3 hospitals to 8 hospitals in Jakarta, Sulianti Hospital is not open 24 hours anymore and only serve until 9pm, certainly emergency is still 24 hours. Private hospitals are also can handle Covid-19 patients, Mitra Keluarga, Bunda and Siloam asap. In Bali there are also Siloam Hospital too, but which one and can handle in monitoring stage, under supervision stage or even positive Covid-19 patients or only certain stages are not clear. At end of March hospital in Galang Island with concrete panels will ready to use, the capacity is 1,000 beds include 50 isolation rooms. This is to anticipate more Covid-19 patients which the curve is still hike.","0"
"The problem with that is that many doctors are saying keep well away from hospitals and pharmacies because that is where you have a higher chance of picking up the virus. So anyone who worries they might have Covid-19 but doesn't may in fact catch it from a visit to a hospital. Pushing the buttons to call a lift or inside the lift, touching the desk at reception when registering at a hospital. It's things like this that are dangerous. The virus can live for up to 5 days on plastic, 4 days on glass, 2 days on steel, 2 - 8 hours on aluminium. And that's assuming everyone is wearing a mask.","0"
"Jokowi, the president of Indonesia has admitted that they haven't been transparent about their Covid cases to avoid panic - Whilst I can see that panic is almost as bad as the virus, it means that we can't trust what is being reported (as is possibly the case for many countries). Also the preventative messages don't seem to be getting through - certainly up until yesterday, I saw very little evidence of any social distancing in Bali and I was still getting lots of massage invites. I think it would be very tricky to be a government in these times and I don't envy them the thin line they need to tread but I think we can safely assume, for our own safety, that what we're getting told isn't the full story and plan accordingly.","1"
"There are several concerns, Hospitals, if the cases break a thousand number, hospital beds maybe are not sufficient, Athletic Villa/Apartment in Kemayoran, Jakarta has facility up to 1,800 beds. Until nowadays more than 50 percent cases are in Jakarta and only one in Bali. Medical persons, midwives and medical students at final level will help medical doctor. Financial, Finance Minister stated that Indonesia is ready for it. Logistics, 2 to 3 months before fasting month usually producer increase the production, there are a lot of biscuit, etc. and Indonesia is exporting biscuit to Europe and Africa, without export, the biscuit in Indonesia will abundant. And the most important thing, rice reserve is enough.","0"
"Sarwa you are floating in the clouds if you honestly believe there is only one case in Bali.","1"
"The fasting month isn't really relevant in Bali, Sarwa, as you no doubt know it's Hindu, not Muslim. Please feel free to post useful information on what is actually happening - for instance that rapid testing will start taking place to accelerate detection and perhaps give us a more accurate idea of the actual numbers in Bali.","0"
"Sarwa, I am happy to know that Indonesia is increasing their biscuit production and exporting biscuits to Europe and Africa, and also that without exporting those biscuits that they will become abundant in Indonesia. But if there is a dire food shortage I really doubt that my family and I will be surviving on biscuits and I also doubt that hotels with tourists will be serving biscuits three times a day. Please get real.","1"
"Indonesian consumption is move from rice to other carbohydrate food, so you can see more many bread shops and also more bread producers and there are also encourage by government for diversification, because importing rice is more difficult than importing wheat, although bread is still more expensive than rice, but the economy is increase, so many more people can buy bread, certainly not for main everyday meal. There are one person from Europe died suddenly on the street in Bali, and people think it is Covid-19 patient, before it advance check/test, a friend of him tell that he has chronic stomach disease and also hearth problem. If someone is positive Covid-19, Indonesia will test it for the second time with Genome Assay Test. Rapid Test is not so accurate, because it will test your blood for the immunoglobuline and it is only can detect after the patient has 7 days positive Covid-19 in the body. So you will missed the patient with 6 days positive Covid-19 in the body. So, cannot depends on the Rapid Test only, but this test can make the people happy, because they had the tested.","1"
"The issue of a potential rice shortage is not so relevant to tourists and more to do with the less affluent part of the Indonesian population. Therefore not really relevant here as we are more concerned with tourists, Incidentally, I buy bread and pay Rp16,000 for a large loaf of good quality sliced bread.","0"
"I was at Bali Jaya mart in Kuta today opposite the morning market, it was about 10.00am so the market was basically closed apart from some street vendors, at least 14 black vans there and lots of officials standing around, I asked the question to my partner and she said they are Government , look at the number plate, then a lot of guys with bottles on their backs holding hoses came out, the market place was being disinfected. They quickly moved on to somewhere else.","1"
"Related to number 299, Bali positive Covid-19 patient became 2 persons with one fatality to death. Rapid test will do at more sites with the priority who have contact with positive Covid-19. More easy to do, so all Indonesia can do it, the result can be got in several housr only. If the result is positive then must do the second test with throat DNA swab.","0"
"The real problem here is that they are not testing enough people. It's pretty obvious that if they test many more people then the number of covid-19 infected people is probably going to skyrocket. Clearly, the more you test the more you are going to find. The suggestion made a week ago that Indonesia along with Singapore and Malaysia had a relatively low number of cases because they were better at handling the Coronavirus is totally wrong as far as Indonesia is concerned and very misleading.","1"
"Absolutely, SuefingWild (post #311). This quote from Anne Barker, the ABC Indonesia correspondent bears out your point. “ Indonesia has done 1,727 tests for coronavirus in a population of about 270 million people.

"Another question for you, Sarwa. There are reports that Indonesian hospitals will have to pay the government owned PT Rajawali Nusantara Indonesia for kits imported from China. Can Bali’s hospitals afford such costs? If not, what happens then?","1"
"Import by government certainly different from I mentioned in number 321. Certainly one million is not much, but not all must be tested. Government has made 'halodoc' application. I'm not install it yet, usually I install something in the midnight for better transfer rate. If you have installed and opened it, you can share it here.","1"

"Richard, many people maybe not smart as you are, you are in self quarantine, maybe because there are government rule, and you know what is the reason. A medical doctor got positive Covid-19 and he quarantine himself, although there are no rule for it previously, because he know about Covid-19. Bogor major go to Turkey and he is tested of Covid-19, the result is positive and he is in the quarantine. In the vlog he said it is necessary to be quarantined, although I only have a small cough. A group of local congress from a regent go to abroad and when back will be tested of Covid-19, but refuse it. I think Balinese are also must be educated of Covid-19, although there are advice from the Balinese elderly people when there are sick season you must stay in your home, but maybe Balinese are not yet feel nowadays is a sick season. Indonesia has many cultures, if you still do not understand the Balinese, you may visit other area of Indonesia, so you can understand, why they and why they not. You cannot make a generalization for all of Indonesia with more than 700 hundred tribes.","1"
"And I am not sure that I agree with Sarwa that the reason that the Balinese do not have a single case of Covid-19 is because they feel it is not the sick season yet. I find that unbelievable and frankly a bit ridiculous. Obviously if a Balinese is sick he or she is not going to wait until the ""sick season"" before seeking treatment.","1"

"So, the lack of effective testing is no longer due to a non existent “sick season” but, instead, it’s due to alleged religious fanaticism, based on the behaviour of some Muslim adherents on a totally different Indonesian island? The fact remains that the national government is woefully unprepared for the spread of this virus.

There is a real danger there just like many places in the world but truthful information is vital. No one wants to stay somewhere that cannot cope with this situation.","1"

"Scary stuff BB but should come as little surprise to many of us who could see the wood from the trees early on. If Indonesia had been transparent & honest about the situation, there would have been no Australian or overseas tourist visiting Bali for at least the past month!! This was calculated and shows that $$$ comes before safety in some corners of the globe. Indonesian propaganda & cover ups. It worked. I lost count of the numerous ""You have a better chance of catching it in OZ' type comments, that I saw from Australians trying to justify why they should not cancel. It doesn't look good for Indonesia. As usual, salt of the earth type folk will pay the price for incompetency and lies, not those in power and making the decisions. There will be an ICU bed available for them should they need it. Rest assured.","0"

"Yes it is very sad. This reported high death rate is most likely an indication that in fact the real death rate is probably about the same as everywhere else and a lot more people are infected than reported. As many Balinese do not go anywhere near a doctor their entire lives, the rate of infection is probably even higher especially as the Balinese live closely packed together. This is clearly a world wide problem, but I do think it will hit the Balinese harder than in many other places. Keep safe everyone","0"

"Certainly using laboratory, use reagant to test the sample. All laboratory persons can do it, after training and they have been trained yet.

Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong isn't letting non-citizens through. These are where most of the connecting flights from Bali to the U.S. would happen. Also in bold print - ""The U.S. govt doesn't anticipate arranging repatriation flights from Indonesia at this time"". Seeing the very late response that Indonesia has taken with all the denials, I fear that this virus is going to hit them like a ton of bricks with many fatalities. Very sad.

"unfortunately there are people still in Bali who should have either delayed going on their holiday in the first place or left long ago but they were determined to have their 'holiday' . They ignored all warnings and recommendations and some who did decide to go home left it far too late, just trying to squeeze a few more days in before booking a flight found themselves facing cancelled flights and closed airports. Some of these people are now regretting their choices and face a very extended stay in Bali. They will have many challenges as many hotels, restaurants, shops and necessary services are closed and those that are still trading are not far from closing their doors. Those who are left now have plenty of time to reflect on their decisions. Seriously they don't have their heads screwed on straight. It is not only US citizens who are in trouble, other countries have closed their airports also. The health system in Bali is very strained and far below standards of other countries and has no hope of coping. True numbers of cases will never be known. There will never be enough testing carried out, and like other illnesses ie Dengue the locals usually don't seek medical assistance and hence the number of cases are far from the truth. Correspondence I have had with someone who was in hospital in Bali being 'treated' for Corona virus described that even those in 'isolation' wards were being kept in the dark in regards to their test results.

So, rapid test, test your immunity as general, but what is definitely infected must be confirmed. If you get blood test and your leukocyte is high mean you are infected, but what kind of infection, must be test further. Based on Jakarta rapid test, from 27, 000 rapid test is only 3 percent is positive and are not mean all have Covid-19.

Recovery needs from 2 weeks to 6 weeks, so if flattening the curve can be done in 2 weeks, so it is good. Data April 10, 2020, cumulative positive Covid-19 patient is 3,512, died 306, so mortality rate is 8.7 percent, still high, but has slightly drop from 10 percent. You must focus in recovery rate, because recovery rate will increase, but mortality rate will decrease.","1"

"I had a 15 night cruise planned for Christmas with 5 Indonesian ports of call. I already made the decision to cancel almost a month ago based on publicly available information (not necessarily news reports). Things are really bad in Indonesia and other parts of the world. The Indonesian government in particular were too slow to take it seriously and thereby too slow to act. Now it's going to bite them on the bum, ten fold. Regarding hope for a vaccine, it should be understood that to date, there have been no vaccines developed for the other coronaviruses or even HIV. That's with all the squillions of dollars that that have been tipped in to develop a solution. It's going to be a long ride and we've only just buckled up.","0"
"I read an article on Kompas. com last night which estimates that around 32,000 people are infected with corona virus in Djakarta alone. This estimation has been done taking into account the relatively few number of tests done and the death rate of detected cases. It sounds like it will be a terrible time for all of Indonesia and as there appears still to be no real lockdown of movement it will hit Bali hard as well soon. ","0"
"there is this article which I originally posted in the Indonesia forum. “Updated modelling from University of Indonesia researchers suggests Indonesia could now have a million infected patients, and that more than 120,000 people will die by the end of May if the government does not impose a nationwide lockdown and mass swab testing.”","0"
"Basically, the less accurate the statistics and testing and the more corrupt the government of a given country, the longer the epidemic will remain and the more widespread it will become. Secrecy and misinformation is a friend to this virus. This is why Indonesia is in such big trouble. No country is going to take at face value infection numbers published by a government who’s own foreign minister promoted the idea that ‘prayer’ would keep the people safe. Countries that have managed to bring Covid-19 under control will simply not risk opening their borders anymore to ones which can’t guarantee the safe passage of travellers. That means that until a vaccine is found the Bali-Australia tourism relationship is frozen in time. Indefinitely.","1"

"Erm, FreshPrince, that link you posted to the Asia Times news article, ""Bali’s mysterious immunity to Covid-19"" , actually gives credibility to Sarwa's contention. The Asia Times author is somewhat bewildered as to why but acknowledges that the Bali status with the virus is consistent with published numbers - i.e the Bali government is telling the truth. He pads the article out of course with speculations and pans the Indonesian govt. but we are where we are so those are just opinions. Given them's the facts then quantitatively as of 15/04/2020 Bali with 98 cases and 2 deaths is doing better than Tasmania with 165 cases and 6 deaths. Having 8 to 9 times the Tasmanian population and Java as a neighbour amplifies matters further. Qualitatively they seem ok too because all but 13 of the cases are imported from overseas workers or Java. Even the 13 cases look to be properly contact traced back to the imports and the follow up done properly. Their Ruby Princess moment is however about to hit with shiploads of returning cruise ship workers starting to arrive at Benoa from tomorrow. That will be a huge challenge but at least they have the experience from elsewhere to draw on - even if it's how not to do it, that's still valuable.","1"
"I was very aware of the content of the blog post that I shared. The reason for doing so is that the author appears to be as deluded as our friend Sarwa. It's basically paid government propaganda. The goal is to carry on downplaying the situation in the hope that tourists will start flocking back sooner rather than later. General theme being that Bali is somewhat under control or no worse than many other more developed countries.","0"
"The important thing is how many local transmission is happened. Most of Covid-19 in Bali is not local transmission. If local transmission is a lot, so it means the tracing is done maybe, but do not do until finish. Maybe they found only cluster, but how about sub cluster or sub sub cluster.","1"
"Indonesia has the highest number of Covid-19 fatalities in Asia excluding China but its testing numbers continue to lag its smaller neighbours. The fact remains that, until testing is comprehensively undertaken across its population, no one should entertain thoughts of a holiday there. 30,000 tests across 270 million people is not an adequate gauge of the existing level of the virus’ spread.","0"

"To all fellow travelers, At this hardship time, i think that there is no point on arguing on what is right, what is wrong. As a business owner in Bali myself, even though our corporate office is not in Bali, i would like to share a little bit of my thoughts. I was born in Indonesia, studied high school in Perth then college in Seattle so i have mixed experience on how they handle things in each country. Indonesian health care is not as good as other countries that is the truth. Lack of testing is also must be admitted by everyone. However, i believe that Indonesian weather and our daily life help us a lot in this matter. Hot weather i believe is not going to kill the virus, but at least it will make the virus less active. The problem is that in Jakarta our hot zone at the moment, have too many people. They all live in very very crowded areas so even though the virus is less active, i believe it is still spreading but not as severe as our fellow european/american. People's life in Jakarta is very tough and they already get used to on below healthy standard living. Their immune system is much much better i believe. If you look the pictures when flood came in, those children are swimming on the flood. Just think on how much virus/bacteria, etc on that water ? Bali is a little bit different and i believe the reasons on why there is only a little infected is because Bali is not as dense as Jakarta / Java Island. And that helps a lot. This moment of hardship will strengthen the bonds among us, whether families, friends, partners, communities. Think positive and let the world bring back our glorious travelling time.","1"
"Interesting article in the Jakarta post, that Indonesia is running out of testing kits, only 35,000 left. Interesting that they are running out of supply of reagents. According to Sarwa, Indonesia is able to produce their own reagents, something that even more advanced countries are unable to do. Just another reason not to believe our resident propagandist.","1"

So, if someone do rapid test and get negative result, must do the second rapid test a week later. And if the result of rapid test is positive, so must do swab test. So, you must check, it is for one test, 2 tests or 3 tests, Beware of hidden cost. And how about the cost, if you must stay there.","1"

Let's take another look and use the subheadline for a bit more context

"Ryan, you have cross culture. I do not know where are you live in Indonesia and where are you born, so I cannot predict about your culture, because Medanese, Javanese, Balinese, etc are different. I appreciate Balinese with ethical work and discipline, maybe you can feel it. And discipline is important for social distancing. Perth is in West Australia, not busy as in NSW with many Covid-19 positive patients. And between Perth and Sydney is also not too busy as Sydney and Melbourne. Australia get advantage that there are no land border with the neighbour. Whereas all states in mainland USA, except Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico are relatively can be accessed easily by car, not train, and most family in USA have at least a car and one of their hobby are visit camping grounds. About health care, we must differentiate between insurance individual health care and insurance government health care, BPJS which cover low income people. Indonesia learn it from Cuba which Cuba is not developed country, but has the best health care in the world, besides Japan as a rich country. I have relative in USA and work for the insurance, so I know about insurance for low income people and why there are Obama Care and then reduce the fund by Trump and nowadays Trump cut fund to WHO. Jakarta has only about 8 million people, but in work day time there are 11 to 12 million people, because of commuter people from surrounding Jakarta, so no wander if the Covid-19 patients in Jakarta and surrounding are a lot, but Thousands Islands certainly in Jakarta have no Covid-19 patients, because is and islands and the traffic between Jakarta mainland area and the islands is not much. The immune system is depends on the antibody. The antibody will increase if get infection by nature or by vaccine. If we get used with something dirty, so the antibody can increase, as example give bread/biscuit to cleaning service on the street and he/she only wipe his/her hand to his/her dirty clothes and then directly eat it. The question are we want to be a cleaning service, stay at modest dormitory with maybe not all the guests are healthy or stay in Nusa Dua Resort Area.","0"
"Yes, Thursday saw an increase in cases but the Official breakdown is that only 3 of these were local transmissions. Bali has a number of cruise ships docking this week and it’s the disembarking Indonesian crew who seem to make up a number of the new cases. The good news - if there is any - is that numbers are reducing again and yesterday saw 11 new cases and today just 7, although one more death has been announced who appears to be not Indonesian. Whilst the level of testing here should not breed any complacency I can assure you that the authorities and local banjars are now taking this pandemic very seriously, and enforcing masks wearing, and hand sanitation stations or disinfectant gels are appearing everywhere still open. Additionally the governor has annexed several large hotels for the quarantine of returning crews so whilst not a good situation I feel it’s not as bleak as many are implying. Lack of food and work for many however is a really pressing need now. Cheers","0"

They have limited the number of tests per day in order to minimize groups and possibly complicate the spread of the virus. The Bupati has quarantined the entire village, no entry in or out.

"Interesting - my husband's friend who lives in Canggu has just told us that he thinks his family had the virus in January. His wife went to Lombok for a weekend away with a friend and encountered some Chinese tourists across the breakfast buffet who seemed to have a heavy cold. She and her friend joked about the virus but didn't think too much of it. She comes home, gets the runs and the shivers, he catches it but they end up getting better and the kids didn't seem to get it at all. Now a lot of their friends in the area are saying the same thing - they had some kind of fluey thing at the beginning of the year. So I am thinking that the theory that the virus has already had a first wave in Bali might just be true. Ideally they would get tests to see if they have antibodies but apparently that's just not possible so we'll probably never know but it does make the low numbers now seem more feasible... And he said that shops and restaurants are slowly starting to open again.","1"
"Hi, Yes, this is one of the many rumours circulating in Bali. The numbers are remarkably low with most cases stemming from returning workers. There are now no new cases amongst foreigners and low numbers of local transmissions. What is even more striking is that the recovery rate is very high so that of the 279 cases in Bali only 100 are still active, the rest have recovered. I also felt pretty bad in early March after a trip to Malaysia and certainly had a cough for a week or so. At the time only Sanglah was testing and it wasn’t advisable to go and add to the burden, so I’ll never know what it was. What is true is that March and April were hot and humid and that probable helps with lowering transmission. Further to my last post, Gianyar is reopening some beaches but mostly for local fishermen. Beaches on the north coast remain open. Cheers","0"

It could be another 8 months before things improve, but by then many businesses would have folded and Bali will be a very different place. People must remember that. There are many vlog's on YouTube from locals and expats who talk about general things in Bali. It's a good place to see how things are over there and to ask these YouTuber's questions for updates on say your favourite restaurant or hotel or night spot. Stay safe, stay healthy! ;)","1"

"The Indonesian authorities are no doubt well aware of the situation in Australia where citizens are not permitted to leave the country without special government approval. Bali obviously has to focus on available markets and Australia is no longer in that category. China, on the other hand, has the virus under control and air travel by its citizens is now almost back to last years levels. Non-believing people can easily check the Flight Aware realtime maps to verify that for themselves. It's quite bizarre - panning down to Australia is reminiscent of those night time satellite pics of the North Korean border with the South; one side a sea of light and the other in total darkness. Similarly to China, the Japanese and South Koreans are coming back to life. The Europeans, Brits and North Americans are heading into their winter with infection cases rising but realistic measures being taken to control the impact. Increasingly cynical populations are focusing on hospitalisation and year on year death stats. If these last continue to flatten despite infection cases rising then lockdown style measures will no longer be tolerated & travel restrictions will quickly follow.Even though there are good prospects of attracting more visitors from internationally travelling countries they won't make up for Bali's lost Australian visitors. The government is accordingly looking at evolving non-tourist opportunities and in this new world, there are lots of those. On an encouraging note, the virus seems to be achieving already what was previously impossible, the central government is planning to overhaul immigration and make it friendly to targeted long term professionals. The world moves on.","1"

"you need to get real. “The situation is pretty controlled here”. Is that what the Singapore Authorities told you. Sort of thing you will hear from a “police” state. Singapore has been part of the problem. A British guy who was at a conference in Singapore got infected in Singapore. Who knows how many other people at the conference were infected or the people in the hotels that all the conference members were staying at. The Brit came back to UK then went on to a ski holiday in France where he infected 7 other people including a child. He then flew back to the UK with 168 other passengers. He is now under quarantine but the Govt are trying to track down everybody that he had contact with.","1"
"In the French ski resort although they are not generally worried they are now trying to track down the children that were in a class with the infected child. This is all over the news and newspapers. So rather than being worried about the situation in Bali you really need to be more worried about the real situation in Singapore.","1"
"The confirmed number of cases in Singapore is increasing daily with I believe 43 cases compared to around 18 cases two or three days ago and it is the country with one of the highest number of cases outside of China. In Indonesia the four confirmed cases are from Indonesians who were in Singapore but escaped to Batam island and currently there is a police chase to find them. ","0"
"Whether of not there are other cases in Indonesia still has not been confirmed by the Indonesian government bu officially it is zero as far as I know. So I think it would only be safe for you to visit Bali if you are certain that you are not bringing the virus to Bali.","1"
"As a side note, were you planning to spend 32 days in Bali? Are you aware of the visa implications?","1"
"About 4 Indonesia persons go to Batam, I must clarify. Indonesia get information from Singapore 4 days, after the 4 persons arrive Batam. When there are positive 2019-nCov patients, so Singapore will trace who are contact with the patient before and some of them is the 4 persons, but the 4 person have gone back to Indonesia in healthy condition, so all of them pass the screening in Singapore and also pass the screening when enter Batam. As WHO protocol they must be quarantine as Indonesian persons from Wuhan and are quarantined in Natuna. So, the 4 persons right now is quarantined in their house for 14 days and have been checked twice a day, morning and afternoon. Until nowadays there are healthy.","1"
"They have now identified that the Brit guy was at a conference in the Grand Hyatt in Singapore. Apparently amongst others he infected a guy in the French ski resort who flew back to Spain who now as the virus. The “carrier” is from Brighton. They have now closed a Health/GP surgery in Brighton where an employee has contracted the virus. So going by reports Bali is far safer than Singapore ... and the UK.","1"
"I think you got my message wrong. I am only spending 7 days in Bali. What I meant was that I have 32 days before the actual trip.","1"
"Appreciate all of your feedback guys. I'm a Singaporean myself. I shall not go into debates with anyone on behalf of my country regarding this situation. Just like all of you, I pray that things get better. I will head on to Bali as planned.

I would be more worried travelling to Indonesia than Singapore.","1"

Hand sanitizer which we always use when travelling. My fear is on the plane not on the ground. We are being careful not paranoid. I am more worried about getting my usual dose of winter bronchitis while snow skiing which has similar symptoms to the virus and getting quarantined for 2 weeks for bronchitis.","1"
"Singapore is paying the price for being a Global city and for being too transparent and truthful. The very reason why Indonesia has opted to pretend it has zero cases. Can you imagine Bali, which depends almost totally on tourism, unlike Singapore, reporting a similar number of cases as Singapore?","1"
"Because Uma knows that it is impossible for Bali to have zero cases. Singaporeans know how Indonesia functions better than most others. When Singapore says it has 50 cases it means exactly 50 verified cases, nothing more and nothing less. If Indonesia say they have 0 cases, one can add '1' in front and another 3 zeroes behind.","1"
"Not that Indonesia does not have the ability to conduct tests. They rather not face the truth, having to publicise it, and negatively impact the economy. Their struggling economy matters more than some lives.","1"
"Let's be real folks. 5000 passengers a day from China to Bali in Dec, Jan and 5 days in Feb. Then Indonesians travelling to China also. Who are they trying to kid? No-one in their right mind would believe there are no cases in Indonesia. More than likely the testing and screening is not adequate or non-existent. Sick people are probably just staying home rather than going to the doctors. The rest of the world will hear about it when their hospitals and morgues are suddenly overflowing...I think it's in Australias' (and the worlds) best interests to send a medical team there to screen and test and send any results back to Oz to find out the real situation.","1"
"I’m flying via Singapore ina couple of months and have been tracking the response, seems that they are doing a fantastic job to manage the consequences, particularly around incentivising reporting of symptoms and tracking and isolating contacts. There seems to be a consensus forming that there are almost certainly cases in Indonesia but likely undetected or detected and unreported. If that’s the case, there will be consequences for tourists pouring in to Bali and taking no precautions because they think it’s “safe”. Meanwhile Singapore is getting called out for being transparent about numbers, and suffering the consequences in terms of tourism.","0"
" am here - flew in on 10th and I was the only one that I could see with a mask on my flight besides the welcoming Hostess initially. When I went through the Immigration lines there were only a few people with masks on Chinese and some odd Europeans so and the some of the Government staff. I only wore mine on and off up to the Visa approval then not bothered since - got too hot with it on. Felt silly when no-one else was bothering but do what you need to do for your own peace of mind. So at that time there didn't seem to be a big scare for them BUT YOU DO HAVE TO FILL IN A HEALTH FORM ANSWERING QUESTIONS BEFORE THEY LET YOU IN AND IF YOU HAVE ANY SYMPTOMS ON THEIR LIST YOU ARE FURTHER SCREENED.","1"
"I did see before I left there were 5000 stranded Chinese tourist who couldn't get back home too, I am in a Villa and not doing too much in the populated precincts but didn't see people with masks on in the streets either when I initially stayed in Kuta. Tourism has been hard hit here as the hotel staff and taxi drivers have been telling us too, so keep an eye on the updates and then come to Bali and overspend. A little of our money goes a long way to feeding families here so be generous. The rupiah is about 90% now so 90,000 for our $10. Come on in the waters fine :) At my Villa anyway. Enjoy your holiday and follow safe health practices as recommended - sanitise your hands and watch the coughers etc.","1"

"IMHO it's also not just concerns about getting the virus, but being traced because of someone else that was in your vicinity on a plane or hotel etc. Then you can get quarantined or asked to self isolate, would not be the most convenient of things to deal with I'm sure. Further, is the possibility with a trip that long for something to happen whereby the situation worsens and Bali has an outbreak then all flights in/out get cancelled and you get stuck there in isolation for awhile. Don't think I'd be willing to want to go through that even if I wasn't concerned about being infected.","1"
"While it is business as usual on Bali (we are living here now!), there is no way to predict if or when COVID-19 will be detected here. As of today, 9 people are being monitored in Bali because they sat next to someone who tested positive for COVID-19 on a flight from KL. However, as we’ve just seen with the new cases in Italy and Iran, no one can predict where in the world it will pop up next, including your home country.","1"
" At the moment, it's pretty safe to come here and the biggest risk would be on the plane or in the airport, not actually in Bali itself. Nobody here is wearing masks or staying at home or any of the other things that are happening in China / Italy / Iran.

"Actually thermometers are not useful at all for detecting the virus and I'm unaware of anybody claiming that they are.

"Fair enough - a bit cynical  but you are probably right. They all love waving something around to look active ... or turning up en masse when one person could have done the job. I've got one to check the walls on our brick oven but haven't used it for checking our family temperratures.","1"

Reading back on a page or 2 of earlier comments I can see post 31 & 32 from Singapore has a bee in his/her bonnet but that's not unusual for some Singaporeans.

"No. you don't sound annoyed at all. Bali is a little bit cross however because of all those cases of Covid-19 that Singapore managed to bring into the region - the UK is somewhat miffed also. Then you play goody two shoes and try to say everybody else did the same & must imitate you to solve a problem they don't have. Well, just as with SARs, everybody else didn't do the same. How many cases of SARS did your country manage to bring in from Hong Kong and China in 2003? - 238 infections with 33 deaths as I recall. Meanwhile, your long-suffering neighbours ended up with 2 in Indonesia and 6 in Malaysia. It's all very well to pose about how great Singapore is at cleaning up these messes but it would be far better to not create them in the first place.","1"

I may be wrong but I don’t know of any hot/humid country that has had a bad outbreak of this coronavirus. Southeast Asia has an extremely close link to China and this region had detected cases of coronavirus long before Europe and the US, but it never blew up here the way it currently is there Actually, the virus has been a complete joke in this part of the world.

I realize some of you think Indonesia is undercounting or covering up coronavirus cases, and that may be true to some extent, but it would be absolutely impossible and absurd to suggest that the virus has been catastrophic here the way it has been in Europe or China.

In Bandung, Bandung Zoo is always open when there are Bird Flu in 2007 with visitors only 50 to 100 a day and nowadays when there are Covid-19 visitors are relatively stable as usual Sunday.

"I wonder why then the reported cases and fatality rate also has nearly doubled in the Philippines in the last 24 hrs. Hence the introduced community quarantine throughout the country from today. Last time I looked Philippines was in the Tropics.","1"
"The Philippines has a whopping 11 deaths from coronavirus after it’s been present there for almost 2 months. Their first case was way back in January. Italy has 1,500 deaths. Even though it’s much further from China and cases just started there recently.","1"
"But if you guys want to stay home, then that’s your choice to make. I still feel much safer here in SE Asia than I would in Europe or the US. Australia and New Zealand would seem to be better alternatives too, but I think the virus just arrived there so it’s hard to say how that will play out. All you have to do is look at the total mortality numbers and the amount of time the virus has been in the country. Those are hard to ignore.","1"
"That post refers only to people over 60 with an underlying illness and does not tell anyone to stay in Europe, it simply asks YOU a question whether you think people over 60 should travel. Read it again. By the way, I've lived in Indonesia 8 years, Singapore 9 years, Malaysia 12 years, Hong Kong 7 years, Bali 2 years and Taiwan 2 years and worked all around Asia for most of my adult life. Now I live in West Java.","1"
"The answer to your question is that there has been 1 coronavirus death in Bali. Most countries in Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Singapore, still have 0 deaths, even though this region was the first to get it from China. So yes, even if I had preexisting health conditions I would feel as comfortable in Bali as anywhere else.","0"
"Is the heat thing just a hunch? Sure. But the very low mortality figures in SE Asia do not lie. They are extremely low when you consider the virus has already been here for almost 2 months. For whatever reason, Southeast Asia has not been hit hard by this virus. Dengue still worries me more. And you don’t need to tout your Asia credentials, I’ve been all over this continent and I live here too.","0"
"This Sunday night there are match between Persib Bandung and PSS Sleman in Bandung, and the stadium is still full with the soccer fans, but since tomorrow Indosiar TV has announced that Dangdut Music Contest will still on air without any audience or suppoters. I hope Bandung and Bali will be better than Jakarta.","1"
"The FCO have just advised against all but essential travel to all of Indonesia.","1"
"Bandung authorities are stepping up to deal with the coronavirus since the latest death here. Strange that they are allowing football matches to proceed though but hopefully the stadium will not be packed with supporters.","1"
"2 days before the match, the governor suggest, but maybe insist to cancel or do the match without soccer fans, the tickets have been sold out and the match day is Persib Anniversary, so the match is still happen with full of soccer fans with hand sanitizing at the entrance gate. In Bandung, only a few people use mask and also in Bekasi, in Jakarta is also no panicking. People know that possibility to get Covid-19 is less than get Dengeu Fever and Covid-19 is less dangerous than Bird Flu.","1"
"Do you really believe the death figures? From countries like India, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia? The only one I would believe is Singapore. Guaranteed the other countries would not even have the proper testing equipment. So you, like Sarwa need to stop dribbling. You both are pushing understated information. I just hope no-one else reading these posts believes you.","1"
"Are you in Australia experience with Dengeu Fever and Bird Flu. Indonesia even experience with SARS and MERS since 2002.","1"
"Singapore has zero deaths so far because of its excellent healthcare system and its efforts to minimise spread of Covid-19. But can expect some deaths sooner or later.","1"
"While the rest of the 3rd world South East Asian countries have low death rates, because deaths from Covid-19 would be classified as death from ""Pneumonia"" . They would not even be tested for Covid-19.","1"
"People want test in the first stage also, but it is not necessary, even in this stage they are not in the isolation room, at the second stage they are in the isolation room, tests will be done, not directly test of Covid-19, but test of corona virus, if negative you will release from the second stage, if positive you will in the 3rd stage and the sample will be tested in Jakarta. Airlangga University in Surabaya can do it also and maybe will test it also soon. If the Covid-19 test is positive, there are the second test and it is called Genome DNA Assay Test to avoid False Positive of Covid-19 test. I do not know the other countries do also Genome DNA Assay Test or not.","1"
"Usually in the second stage from 8 persons, only one is positive Covid-19 or even from 7 persons no one with positive Covid-19. In the second stage if someone has clinical sight of Covid-19, so without wait for Covid-19 test result can be transferred to third stage. I think South Korea do better than Singapore to handle Covid-19. Cases and death rate is higher than Singapore, but SK certainly bigger than Singapore.","1"
